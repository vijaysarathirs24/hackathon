2.  Prototype Refiner Agent
Input: Prototype details

Output: 3 UX improvements

Validates: JSON and exact number of improvements

3.  Pitch Deck Composer Agent
Input: metadata + features + feedback

Output: 6 slides and a 3-min script

Validates: Slide count (6) and script word count (≤ 500)

4.  User Testing Strategy Agent
Input: metadata + features + prototype

Output: Objectives, 5 testers, delivery method, script

Validates: Completeness and strict field structure

5.  Feedback Integration Agent (RAG)
Input: Feedback + previous outputs

Retrieves: Related UX trends from a FAISS vector store

Output: Feedback summary, 3 update recommendations, updated materials

 Data Storage
All project sessions are stored in projects.db using SQLite, with each project having:

project_name, metadata, features, prototype_feedback, pitch_materials, test_plan, and refined_outputs.

 UI Design
Dark Theme: #617AA8 (primary), #F3F0F0 (text), #35363B (secondary)

Custom CSS: Smooth buttons, gradient headers, blurred glass cards, and polished footer
